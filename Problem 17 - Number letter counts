## If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, 
## five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

## If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written 
## out in words, how many letters would be used?


## NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 
## (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 
## (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when 
## writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

## The answer is 21124.
