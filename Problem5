## 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 
## 1 to 10 without any remainder.

## What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the 
## numbers from 1 to 20?

## The answer is 232792560.

## I'm using the method of prime factorization. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple#Finding_least_common_multiples_by_prime_factorization

smallestmultiple<-function(x=20){
source('sieve.R')
  y<-sieve(x) ## generate a vector of the first x primes. This guarantees that primes less than x will be generated
  y<-y[y<=x]  ## keep only primes whose value is less than x primefactorpower<-vector(mode='numeric',length=length(y)) ## initialize prime factor power vector
  primefactorpower<-vector(mode = 'numeric',length=length(y)) ## initializing vector
  for(i in 1:length(y)){
    primefactorpower[i]<-max(floor(log(1:x,y[i]))) ## finds the highest power of a given prime in the set 1:x and stores it
  }
  prod(y^primefactorpower) ## gives the product of the vectorized powers of primes
}
