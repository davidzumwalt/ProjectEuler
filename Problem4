## A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

## Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## The answer is 906609.

palindromenumber<-function(){
  source('isnumberpalindrome.R') ## requires my isnumberpalindrome.R function which checks if a number is a palindrome
  x<-900:999 ## in principle, one could go from 1:999, but the largest palindrome of 3-digit numbers is likely to follow the same pattern as 2-digit numbers
  t<-tcrossprod(x,x) ## make a matrix of all possible product combinations
  max(t[lapply(t,function(x) isnumberpalindrome(x))==TRUE]) ## keep only those values which are palindromes, then return the largest one
  
  ## this can also be used to find the second (or any position) largest palindrome for a given number of digits
}
