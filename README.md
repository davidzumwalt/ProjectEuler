# ProjectEuler
Here are my solutions to various problems taken from Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/)

For each of these problems, I used the R statistical programming language to solve them. R is not typically the fastest language, but it is widely used in data science so it pays to become familiar with it. Additionally, it has some very useful functions and packages for linear algebra that make it easy to write code in relatively few lines when solving these and many other problems.

If you are going to run this code in R, I recommend using RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/).
