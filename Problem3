## The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

## What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

## This requires my sieve of Eratosthenes program which creates a list of prime numbers.

## The answer is 6857.

largestprimefactor<-function(x = 600851475143){
  source("sieve.R")
  y<-sieve(sqrt(sqrt(x))) ## initialize a vector of prime numbers
  q<-0
  for (i in y) { ## traverse the vector sequentially
    if(!x%%i){ ## check if each prime number is a factor of the input value
      q<-i ## if so, update the variable to the new prime (which is always increasing)
    }
  }
  q ## return the last prime number in the list which was a factor of the input value
}
