## Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the 
## previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
  
##  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

## By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not 
## exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## The answer is 4613732.

evenfibonaccisum<-function(x=4e6){  ## x is the value at which we want the sum to stop
  source('fibonacci.R') ## This function requires my fibonacci calculator function.
  f<-0 ## initialize
  i<-3 ## Notice that every third number in the sequence is even. No need to check every number for even-ness.
  while(fibonacci(i)<=x) {
    f<-f+fibonacci(i) ## add up every third fibonacci number, which are the even-valued terms.
    i<-i+3
  }
  f ## return the sum of all even-valued numbers in the sequence which is less than or equal to x.
}

## > system.time(evenfibonaccisum())
##    user  system elapsed 
##       0       0       0
