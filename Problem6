## The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

## 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
## The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

## (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
## Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the 
## first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

## Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the 
## first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## The answer is 25164150.

## This is just as easily computed using Gauss' trick for running sums, but
## this simple method in R takes almost no computation time anyway.

## Recall Gauss' trick: sum(1:n) = n*(n+1)/2
## A similar trick for the sum of squares: sum(1:n^2) = n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6
