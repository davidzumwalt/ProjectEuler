## A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for 
## which,

## a2 + b2 = c2
## For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

## There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
## Find the product abc.

## The answer is 31875000.

## This problem is actually just the special case of problem 39, Integer Right Triangles.

## I solved problem 39 first, and then removed one for loop and made small changes to compute abc,
## where c=sqrt(sum(k^2)), as k contains the one pair of valid (a,b) solutions for this triplet.

## Therefore k = c(a,b).

pythagtriplet <- function(x = 1000) {
    k <- numeric() ## clear a vector so that we can store valid triangle lengths in it
    for (i in 1:x) { ## It is guaranteed that the length of one side cannot exceed the perimeter. I could probably pare this down further.
      a <- x * (2 * i - x) / (2 * (i - x)) ## See comments for justification.
      if(a<=0) break ## We only care about positive solutions.
      if(a==Inf) break ## For 2i=j or i=j, a blows up and the equation is invalid.
      if (a %% 1 == 0) k <- append(k,a) ## store valid solutions in a vector. I checked and growing the vector here doesn't appear to cost any obvious time and it's simpler than having a counter.
    }
    sqrt(sum(k^2))*prod(k) ## c * prod(k) = c * a * b, since k is a vector of valid a and b.
}

## *This deserves some justification.

## The available equations to us are (1) a+b+c=P, and (2) a^2+b^2=c^2.

## We have three unknowns, so we need three independent equations. We only have two, so we can't analytically solve for 
## solutions given a perimeter P. However, we can solve for a (or b) in terms of b (or a) and P by solving (1) for c and 
## placing it in (2), and then solving for a.

## Doing this returns a = (P (2 b-P))/(2 (b-P)) and b!=P. We only care about integer values of a and b, so in the code I 
## check to see if the solution for a, given an integer b, is also an integer. I also don't care about negative solutions, 
## since they don't represent real triangles, and I only accept solutions for which b!=P, which in my case means I reject 
## a=Inf solutions.

## Going through the list, it can be seen that starting at a small b and working up returns a large a value which decreases 
## as b increases. Therefore, I can get out of the loop once a is negative or 0, since I know all further solutions will be 
## even more negative. This saves some time.

## This solution ends up returning all values for a and b which are solutions to the problem. For example, for p = 120, the 
## solutions returned would be 48, 45, 40, 30, 24, 20. Since all of these numbers are paired with another from the same set, 
## I cut the number of solutions in half to avoid over-counting.

## There are ways of optimizing this further - for example, instead of storing a vector that contains all the values, I could 
## only update a variable if the new solution number is larger than the old one, but I like to see what's going on, and looking 
## at the vector m gives insights into how the solutions are populated, how frequently they occur, and what the mode of the 
## solution space is.
